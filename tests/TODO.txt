- [IN PROGRESS] we need one test project per module, to make sure modules are found properly and can find and link system packages properly.
- we need to review the codeblock project generated for A-B-C. There is a possibility to not have full path in C::B gui. We need to implement it
- we need to review our compiler setup vs C++11
- we need to have one consistent way of finding sources, headers, etc. ( target introspection like cppcheck, or directly like astyle... )
