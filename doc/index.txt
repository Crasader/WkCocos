What is WkCMake?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An easy-to-use portable C++ Build Framework.
It s possible to make your cross-platform C++ building life much easier, just by making few simple and sensible assumptions such as :

 - The project hierarchy is similar in all projects
 - Your own development work is happening on one main target at a time.
 - You will build your different libraies before including them in other projects
 - You want to test them and document them without bothering about all the side tools you need
 - You prefer to rerun cmake, than modify lists of source files everytime you change the structure of your code
 - you want your dependencies to be added where needed, automatically whenever it s possible.

What does it do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WkCMake gives you a few very useful features and make your life easier by :

 - Making your project start easier,
 - Greatly simplifying your build scripts,
 - Simple test builds and run ( CppUnit to come )
 - Automatic Source Code formatting with astyle
 - Automatic Documentation generation with doxygen
 - Automatic dependency detection and propagation
 - Automatically detecting memory leaks ( to come )
 - Simplifying profiler builds and usage ( to come )
 - Simplifying installer routines ( to come )
 - Simpler multi-platform packaging ( to come )

How is it made?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WkCMake heavily depends on **CMake**, and a few other optional tools such as doxygen, astyle, etc.
It s a set of CMake scripts you need to include in your CMakeLists.txt to make your cmake buil scripts even easier.
A non exhaustive list of scripts :

 - WkCMake : Main script, you need to include it and call WkCMakeDir() to define where your WkCMake distribution is located. Everything you need for basic builds will be automatically included and configured
 - WkBuild : Script containing building macros ( and dependency inclusion for compilation )
 - WkLink : Script containint linking macros ( and dependency inclusion for linkage )
 - Even more stuff...

Great - Where should I start ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WkCMake is very easy to start with, just have a look at ours tutorials and start a new simple projects.
You can also have a lok at our tests projects and the reference documentation to have a closer look at how it s actually done under the hood
If you want to participate in any way - we especially need lots of testers on a wide set of platforms, and people keen to integrate new useful tools in the build process - feel free to have a look at the project page at GNA :
https://gna.org/projects/wkcmake/
We always welcome new members, and other CMake addicts ;)
